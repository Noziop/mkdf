# Cherish your git flow or perish!

- Because a well-placed commit is a lifesaver.
- Because a stash is an emotional life jacket.
- Because a good log is the memory of your creation.
- Because a clean rebase is the ultimate class.
- Because a thoughtful merge is peace in the repo.
- Because a tag is a milestone on your path.
- Because a backup is serenity.

**Here, we code, we're versionning, we learn, we fail, we start over... but we never PERISH as long as we CHERISH our git flow.**
